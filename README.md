This project is a smart coffee scale with a webserver hosted on the ESP32-S3.
This scale was designed to be used in conjunction with GaggiMate, but can also be used as a standalone scale. The project is still in a beta phase and is actively being worked on. Please head over to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYp4TSEjSf) server for more info. This scale was inspired by [EspressiScale](https://www.espressiscale.com) but with a non-custom PCB approach. The idea is to be low-cost, easily sourcable scale.

## Installation

Installation instructions are currently under development, for now follow the [link](https://031devstudios.github.io/weighmybru-docs/#/installation/flashing) for step-by-step installation instructions. Additionally, a video is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5SP40Liuq0)

```
  this project requires VSCode with PlatformIO extension installed
```

### Important: Filesystem Upload Required

After uploading the firmware, you **must also upload the filesystem** for the web interface to work:

```bash
# Upload filesystem (required for web interface)
pio run -t uploadfs

# Or use the specific environment for your board
pio run -e esp32s3-supermini -t uploadfs  # For ESP32-S3 Supermini
pio run -e esp32s3-xiao -t uploadfs       # For XIAO ESP32S3
```

**Without the filesystem upload:**
- The device will function normally for scale operations
- The web interface will be unavailable
- You'll see a clear message explaining how to fix this issue
